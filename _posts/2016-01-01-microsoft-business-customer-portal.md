Concept for a business customer portal where a customer can view all of their products and services in one place. Existing systems don't allow a customer to see all of their Microsoft products and services. This concept allows them to see all aspects of their Microsoft assets including software, cloud services and support. Additionally, the customer is enabled to purchase directly from Microsoft.
