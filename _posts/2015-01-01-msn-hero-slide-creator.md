A tool to create and edit hero slides for the MSN homepage. The hero slides are the most prominent pieces of content on the MSN homepage. There can be 10 to 20 slides at any given time on the various editions of MSN. The primary users for this tool are the MSN editors who are primarily concerned with the editorial content.

The existing tools being used were heavily form based. The drawbacks to these existing tools are that it is impossible to see in advance the combination of type and image. It is a matter of trial and error to optimize copyfitting and image cropping.

The primary design approach was to create as much of a WYSIWYG experience as possible. This enabled the editor to see how the headlines and copy fit in the context of the slide layouts.
