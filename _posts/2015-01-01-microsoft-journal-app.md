Conceptual design for a journal application for a pen and touch based Microsoft tablet. Focused on the task of capturing thoughts and ideas, the app consists of a basic set of drawing tools as well as support for 3rd party extensions such as sticky notes or templates. The user can import images, bookmarks or even video clips. Additionally the app makes it easy to organize and move objects between pages.
