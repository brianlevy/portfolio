A tool to create, edit and schedule hero slideshows for the MSN homepage. The hero slideshows on the MSN homepage are constantly changing throughout the day. The content producers needed a tool to enable them to quickly and easily assemble slideshows and post them on the homepage. With stories constantly changing, the app allows the producers to post slideshows on the fly as well as schedule them in advance.
