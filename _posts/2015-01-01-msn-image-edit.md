A set of basic image editing tools for editors and producers to use that work inline with the publishing workflow. The idea is to reduce the need to jump out of the workflow to edit images in a tool like Photoshop. This simple set of tools provide basic image editing functionality such as brightness/contrast and cropping. The tools have some basic presets to help the non-professional to produce quality results.
