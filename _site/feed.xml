        <title>Microsoft Business Center</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Concept for a business customer portal where a customer can view all of their products and services in one place. Existing systems don’t allow a customer to see all of their Microsoft products and services. This concept allows them to see all aspects of their Microsoft assets including software, cloud services and support. Additionally, the customer is enabled to purchase directly from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amazon Roku Interface</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Redesign of the Amazon Instant Video channel interface for the Roku set-top box. The primary goal of this design was to take advantage of new grid based templates made available by Roku. Additionally, the visual design elements were inspired by the Kindle Fire UI which was released around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MSN Image Editing Tool</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A set of basic image editing tools for editors and producers to use that work inline with the publishing workflow. The idea is to reduce the need to jump out of the workflow to edit images in a tool like Photoshop. This simple set of tools provide basic image editing functionality such as brightness/contrast and cropping. The tools have some basic presets to help the non-professional to produce quality results.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MSN Hero Slide Show Manager</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A tool to create, edit and schedule hero slideshows for the MSN homepage. The hero slideshows on the MSN homepage are constantly changing throughout the day. The content producers needed a tool to enable them to quickly and easily assemble slideshows and post them on the homepage. With stories constantly changing, the app allows the producers to post slideshows on the fly as well as schedule them in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MSN Hero Slide Builder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A tool to create and edit hero slides for the MSN homepage. The hero slides are the most prominent pieces of content on the MSN homepage. There can be 10 to 20 slides at any given time on the various editions of MSN. The primary users for this tool are the MSN editors who are primarily concerned with the editorial content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing tools being used were heavily form based. The drawbacks to these existing tools are that it is impossible to see in advance the combination of type and image. It is a matter of trial and error to optimize copyfitting and image cropping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary design approach was to create as much of a WYSIWYG experience as possible. This enabled the editor to see how the headlines and copy fit in the context of the slide layouts.   &lt;/p&gt;

The sales person can store a list of their clients’ menu items to keep track of the products that they stock. They can also calculate the cost difference of using Pernod versus competing brands.&lt;/p&gt;
