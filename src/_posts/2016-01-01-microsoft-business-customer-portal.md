Concept for a business customer portal where a customer can view all of their products and services in one place enabling them to make informed business decisions as they relate to their Microsoft hardware, software and cloud services.

Existing systems donâ€™t allow a customer to see all of their Microsoft products and services or even do business directly with Microsoft. This prevents them from having a complete picture of their business. 

This concept allows them to see all aspects of their Microsoft assets including software, cloud services and support allowing them to manage those assets -- to increase or decrease licenses -- as their business evolves.
