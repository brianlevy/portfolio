The Azure Support Center Case Dashboard is the primary view of a Customer Support Case. It gives the Support Engineer a high level overview of the customer and relevant resource information to help diagnose and solve support issues.

The Health Tab is focused on displaying the health data of the specific Azure resource associated with a Support Case. Support Engineers can view the current state of the resource as well as the state as it was at the time the Support Case was created.
