<div class="proj-description">
<p>I&rsquo;m a veteran UI, UX, and Interaction Designer. I&rsquo;ve been designing interfaces for the web since 2000. I started my career working in print and environmental graphics and still design logos and t-shirts and screen print posters in my spare time. </p>

<p>When I’m not working, I can most likely be found camping, surfing, skateboarding, playing guitar, building stuff and generally enjoying the great Northwest.</p>
