excerpt: "Hi. I am an interaction & graphic designer living a short boat ride from Seattle. A problem solver at heart, I’m most satisfied working in the space where form and function meet" 
---

I have been designing interfaces for the web since 2000. I started my career working in print and environmental graphics. I&rsquo;ve recently started screen printing my own posters and I still love doing the occasional logo or t-shirt.

When I’m not working, I’d rather be camping, surfing, skateboarding, playing guitar, building stuff and generally enjoying the great Northwest.
